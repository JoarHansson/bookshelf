# Bookshelf
A repo for the assignment Bookshelf, within the course of study [Webbutvecklare at Yrgo](https://www.yrgo.se/program/webbutvecklare/).

The assignment was to visually represent a bookshelf and to provide some type of sorting and filtering functionality (for example by letting the user sort by color, alphabetically or by number of pages).
